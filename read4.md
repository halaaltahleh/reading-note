## JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY 

JavaScript makes Web pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the content and markup used in a web page while it is being viewed in the browser .

## Script : 
A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal. 
Scripts are made up of the instructiouctns acomputer can follow step-by-step.
A browser may use different parts of the  Script depending on how  user interacts with the web page . 
Scripts can run different sections of the code in response to the situation around them .

## Writing Script :
When we writing a script , we need :
1- Define the goal :First, you need to define the task you want to
achieve
2- Design the Script : To design a script you split the goal out into a series
of tasks .
3- Code each step : Each of the steps needs to be written in a
programming language that the compu ter
understands .

## EXPRESSIONS :

An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking 
there are two types of expressions. 
1- expression that just assign avalue to avariable. expmle : `var color = 'beige';`
2- EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OrMORE VALUES TO RETURN ASINGLE VALUE exmaple : `var area = 3 * 2;`

## OPERATORS :
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values.
