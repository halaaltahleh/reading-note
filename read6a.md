# Function :

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements)

## JavaScript Function Syntax
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a **name**, followed by parentheses `()`.

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
*(parameter1, parameter2, ...)*

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: `{}`
Function**parameters** are listed inside the parentheses `()` in the function definition.

Function **arguments** are the values received by the function when it is invoked.

Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables
**Function Return**
When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
