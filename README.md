##  Growth Mindset

Growth Mindset is a believe in yourself regardless of your talent, it's a believe in that practice makes everything, just by practice you can make the impossible possible. 

There are keys that remind me to stay in the state of **Growth Mindset**, which are:
1. I need stop *seeking approval*
2. Make some actions everyday which motivate me to keep going on the right way, like watching a specific type of videos.
3. Provide regular opportunities to reflection .
